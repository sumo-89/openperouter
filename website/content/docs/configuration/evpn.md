## Underlay Configuration

In addition to the configuration described in the [underlay configuration section]({{< ref "configuration/#underlay-configuration" >}}), the VTEP (Virtual Tunnel End Point) source must be configured via the `evpn.vtepCIDR` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: Underlay
metadata:
  name: underlay
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  asn: 64514
  tunnelEndpoint:
    cidrs:
    - 100.65.0.0/24
  interfaces:
    - type: NetworkDevice
      networkDevice:
        interfaceName: toswitch
  neighbors:
    - asn: 64512
      address: 192.168.11.2
```

The `tunnelEndpoint.cidrs` field defines the IP range used for VTEP addresses. OpenPERouter automatically assigns a unique VTEP IP to each node from this range. At least one CIDR (IPv4 or IPv6) is required, and both may be specified for dual-stack operation. For example, with `100.65.0.0/24`:

- Node 1: `100.65.0.1`
- Node 2: `100.65.0.2`
- Node 3: `100.65.0.3`
- etc.

A loopback interface is created inside the router namespace with the allocated IP, and OpenPERouter advertises the VTEP IP to the fabric over the BGP underlay session.

#### IPv6 and Dual-Stack VTEP

IPv6-only or dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6) VTEP configurations are supported:

```yaml
  tunnelEndpoint:
    cidrs:
    - 100.65.0.0/24
    - fd00:64::/120
```

When both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs are specified, individual VNIs can select which address family to use via the `underlayAddressFamily` field on the L3VNI or L2VNI resource. When omitted, it defaults to the available family (IPv4 preferred in dual-stack).

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `asn` | integer | Local ASN for BGP sessions | Yes |
| `evpn.vtepCIDR` | string | CIDR block for VTEP IP allocation | Yes |
| `interfaces` | array | List of underlay interfaces to use for connectivity. Each entry is a discriminated union; the `NetworkDevice` type moves an existing host network device into the router namespace, while the `CNIDevice` type provisions an interface inside the router namespace via a CNI plugin. All entries must use the same type: mixing `NetworkDevice` and `CNIDevice` interfaces is rejected | Yes |
| `neighbors` | array | List of BGP neighbors to peer with | Yes |
| `nodeSelector` | object | Label selector to target specific nodes (applies to all nodes if omitted) | No |
| `gracefulRestart` | object | Enables BGP Graceful Restart when present. See [Graceful Restart]({{< ref "graceful-restart" >}}). | No |

## L3 VNI Configuration

L3 VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) configurations define EVPN L3 overlays. Each L3VNI creates a separate routing domain and BGP session with the host.

### Basic L3VNI Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: L3VNI
metadata:
  name: blue
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  vrf: blue
  hostSession:
    asn: 64514
    hostASN: 64515
    localCIDRs:
      - 192.169.11.0/24
  vni: 200

```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `vrf` | string | Name of the VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) instance | Yes |
| `vni` | integer | Virtual Network Identifier (1-16777215) | Yes |
| `underlayAddressFamily` | string | VTEP address family for this VNI (`IPv4` or `IPv6`). Defaults to available family (IPv4 preferred in dual-stack). | No |
| `hostSession.asn` | integer | Router ASN for BGP session with host | Yes |
| `hostSession.hostASN` | integer | Host ASN for BGP session | Yes |
| `hostSession.localCIDRs` | []string | CIDRs for veth pair IP allocation | Yes |
| `nodeSelector` | object | Label selector to target specific nodes (applies to all nodes if omitted) | No |

### Multiple VNIs Example

You can create multiple VNIs for different network segments:

```yaml
# Production VNI
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: L3VNI
metadata:
  name: signal
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  vrf: signal
  vni: 100
  hostSession:
    asn: 64514
    hostASN: 64515
    localCIDRs:
      - 192.168.10.0/24
---
# Development VNI
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: L3VNI
metadata:
  name: oam
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  vrf: oam
  vni: 200
  hostSession:
    asn: 64514
    hostASN: 64515
    localCIDRs:
      - 192.168.20.0/24
```

## What Happens During Reconciliation

When you create or update VNI configurations, OpenPERouter automatically:

1. **Creates Network Interfaces**: Sets up VXLAN interface and Linux VRF named after the VNI
2. **Establishes Connectivity**: Creates veth pair and moves one end to the router's namespace
3. **Adjusts Veth MTU**: Sets the MTU on both veth legs to the underlay NIC's MTU minus 50 bytes to
   account for VXLan encapsulation overhead. MTU calculation is per VRF.
4. **Assigns IP Addresses**: Allocates IPs from the `localCIDRs` range:
   - Router side: First IP in the CIDR (e.g., `192.169.11.1`)
   - Host side: Each node gets a free IP in the CIDR, starting from the second (e.g., `192.169.11.15`)
5. **Creates BGP Session**: Opens BGP session between router and host using the specified ASNs

## L2VNI Configuration

L2VNIs provide Layer 2 connectivity across nodes using EVPN tunnels. Unlike L3VNIs, L2VNIs extend Layer 2 domains rather than routing domains.

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `vni` | integer | Virtual Network Identifier for the EVPN tunnel | Yes |
| `routingDomain` | object | Attaches this L2VNI to a routing domain provided by an L3VNI or L3VPN. When omitted, the L2VNI is a disconnected overlay (east-west L2 only, no VRF, no gateway). | No |
| `routingDomain.type` | string | Type of routing domain provider (`L3VNI` or `L3VPN`) | Yes (when routingDomain is set) |
| `routingDomain.l3vni.name` | string | metadata.name of the L3VNI that provides the routing domain | Yes (when type is `L3VNI`) |
| `routingDomain.l3vpn.name` | string | metadata.name of the L3VPN that provides the routing domain | Yes (when type is `L3VPN`) |
| `gatewayIPs` | string array | IP addresses in CIDR notation for the distributed anycast gateway. Cannot be set without routingDomain. Max 2 (one IPv4, one IPv6). | No |
| `exportRTs` | string array | Route targets attached to Type-2 EVPN routes advertised by this L2VNI. Maximum 100 entries. | No |
| `importRTs` | string array | Route targets accepted when importing Type-2 EVPN routes for this L2VNI. Maximum 100 entries. | No |
| `underlayAddressFamily` | string | VTEP address family for this VNI (`IPv4` or `IPv6`). Defaults to available family (IPv4 preferred in dual-stack). | No |
| `hostMaster.type` | string | Type of host interface management (`LinuxBridge` or `OVSBridge`) | Yes |
| `hostMaster.linuxBridge.lifecycle` | string | How the Linux bridge is provisioned (`Managed` or `External`) | Yes |
| `hostMaster.linuxBridge.name` | string | Name of the Linux bridge to attach to. Only valid when `External` | Only when `External` |
| `hostMaster.ovsBridge.lifecycle` | string | How the OVS bridge is provisioned (`Managed` or `External`) | Yes |
| `hostMaster.ovsBridge.name` | string | Name of the OVS bridge to attach to. Only valid when `External` | Only when `External` |
| `hostMaster.ovsBridge.vlanID` | integer | VLAN (1-4094) this L2VNI uses on the OVS bridge: the host veth becomes an access port for it | No |
| `nodeSelector` | object | Label selector to target specific nodes (applies to all nodes if omitted) | No |

### L2VNI Example

```yaml
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: L2VNI
metadata:
  name: l2red
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  vni: 210
  routingDomain:
    type: L3VNI
    l3vni:
      name: red
  hostMaster:
    type: LinuxBridge
    linuxBridge:
      lifecycle: Managed
  exportRTs:
  - "64514:210"
  importRTs:
  - "64514:210"
```

Route targets use the same `ASN:member` or `IPv4-address:member` formats as
L3VNIs and L3VPNs. Both lists are optional. When they are omitted, the L2VNI
retains the default route-target behavior.

### Sharing one OVS bridge between several L2VNIs

Without `vlanID`, the host veth is a plain port on the OVS bridge and carries
whatever the bridge sends it, so a shared `External` bridge would join every
L2VNI attached to it into one L2 domain. Setting `vlanID` makes the veth an
access port for that VLAN: frames the bridge forwards in the VLAN reach the
L2VNI untagged, and frames from the L2VNI enter the bridge in the VLAN. This is
the shape needed when an OVN-Kubernetes `localnet` network per VLAN shares the
bridge with the router, for example an OVS bridge mapped to a physical network
that several `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork`s with `vlan.mode: Access` use:

```yaml
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: L2VNI
metadata:
  name: l2blue
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  vni: 220
  routingDomain:
    type: L3VNI
    l3vni:
      name: red
  gatewayIPs:
  - 192.168.20.1/24
  hostMaster:
    type: OVSBridge
    ovsBridge:
      lifecycle: External
      name: br-data
      vlanID: 11
```

The VLAN is written in the same OVSDB transaction that creates the port, so the
port never forwards untagged, and it survives router and controller restarts
and re-creation of the veth. If the port already exists with a `vlan_mode`
other than `access` (for example `trunk`), the controller switches it to
`access` and records the previous mode, which it restores when `vlanID` is
removed. Changing `vlanID` re-tags the port; removing it clears the VLAN the
controller set, unless the port has been re-tagged by other means since. A VLAN
set on the port by other means is left untouched while `vlanID` is unset. The
controller changes only its own `external_ids` keys (`openperouter-vlan`,
`openperouter-vlan-mode`) and aborts and retries its write if another client
changed the port in between.

## What Happens During Reconciliation

When you create or update VNI configurations, OpenPERouter automatically:

1. **Creates Network Interfaces**: Sets up VXLAN interface, and a Linux VRF named after the VNI only when `routingDomain` is configured
2. **Establishes Connectivity**: Creates veth pair and moves one end to the router's namespace
3. **Adjusts Veth MTU**: Sets the MTU on both veth legs to the underlay NIC's MTU minus 50 bytes to account for VXLan encapsulation overhead
4. **Attaches the veth**: the veth is connected to the bridge corresponding to the l2 domain
5. **Optionally creates a bridge on the host**: if the bridge `lifecycle` is `Managed`, named `br-hs-<VNI>`
6. **Optionally connects the host veth to the bridge on the host**: if the bridge `lifecycle` is `Managed` or a name
is set, as an access port for `vlanID` when it is set on an OVS bridge

## Per-Node Configuration

All EVPN resources (Underlay with EVPN, L3VNI, and L2VNI) support the optional `nodeSelector` field, which allows you to target specific configurations to specific nodes. This is useful for:

- Multi-rack deployments with different VNIs per rack
- Multi-datacenter clusters with zone-specific configurations
- Selective deployment to worker nodes only
- Hardware-specific configurations

For detailed information and examples, see the [Node Selector Configuration]({{< ref "node-selector.md" >}}) documentation.

## API Reference

For detailed information about all available configuration fields, validation rules, and API specifications, see the [API Reference]({{< ref "api-reference.md" >}}) documentation.
